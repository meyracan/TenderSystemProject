# TenderSystemProject
The project I worked on during my first internship at Senkron Tech.

## Details
This web project's backend part is written in C# with layered architecture. MsSQL is used as a database in the project. The project has Postman API support in the development process and it uses Entity Framework to access the database. The frontend part is written in JavaScript and it uses Angular Framework. This project aims to design an Online Tender Management System suitable for real life. A system where admins can open tenders and clients can find them in the category and price range they want to bid.
